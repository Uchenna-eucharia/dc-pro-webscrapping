### Objectives
-	Track Total Attendance: Ensure accurate tracking of all individuals attending church services, avoiding duplicate entries across dates.
-	Analyze Monthly Attendance Trends: Identify attendance patterns for Sunday services on a monthly basis.
-	Track First-Time Visitors: Calculate the total number of first-time attendees and their trends over the months.
-	Monitor First-to-Second Timer Conversion: Analyze the rate at which first-time visitors return for a second visit.
-	Evaluate Average Attendance: Determine the average monthly attendance to gauge overall engagement.
-	Identify Active Members: Calculate the total number of active church members.
-	Assess Department Engagement: Track the number of individuals actively serving in various departments.

### Process
1.	Data Collection: The church collected service data throughout the year. Data entry was outsourced, but significant cleaning was required to make it analysis ready
2.	Data Cleaning:
-  Removed duplicates.
- Standardized names and dates used fuzzy logic (specifically fuzzy matching techniques) to handle inconsistent or similar entries.
-	Addressed missing values.
3.	Analysis and Visualization:
-	Trends and patterns in attendance data were analyzed.
-	Created dashboards in Power BI.

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and validation.
- Power BI: Dashboards and visualizations.

### Key Insights
-	Seasonal attendance peaks during special events.
-	Services with low engagement identified for improvement.
-	Streamlined data tracking improves decision-making.


### Challenges and Solutions
-	The manual data entry process led to initial inconsistencies, which required substantial cleaning efforts.
-	Managing duplicate entries was a priority to ensure data accuracy using fuzzy logic
